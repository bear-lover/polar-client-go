# Go Client for PolarStreams

Go Client for PolarStreams. PolarStreams is a lightweight, elastic, kubernetes-native event streaming system.

## Installing

```shell
go get github.com/polarstreams/go-client
```

![go build](https://github.com/polarstreams/go-client/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

## Getting started

To start using the Go Client for PolarStreams, import the client package and set the PolarStreams "service Url" when
creating a `Producer` or `Consumer`.

A service Url is composed by the `polar://` scheme followed by the host name or Kubernetes service name,
for example: `polar://polar.streams` refers to the service `polar` in the `streams` namespace.

### Producing messages

In order to publish records to a topic, you need to create a `Producer` instance. `Producer` instances are designed to
be long lived and thread safe, you usually need only one per application.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/polarstreams/go-client"
)

// ...

producer, err := polar.NewProducer("polar://polar.streams")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Discovered a PolarStreams cluster with %d brokers\n", producer.BrokersLength())

topic := "my-first-topic" // The topic will be automatically created
message := strings.NewReader(`{"hello": "world"}`)
partitionKey := "" // Empty to use a random partition

if err := producer.Send(topic, message, partitionKey); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

### Consuming messages

To read messages from a topic, you need to create a `Consumer` instance and set the group name that the consumer
belongs to.

When multiple consumers from a group are subscribed to a topic, each consumer in the group will receive messages
from a different set of the partitions within the topic.

`Consumer` instances are designed to be long lived. You usually need only one per application.

```go
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/polarstreams/go-client"
)


// ...

group := "group1"
consumer, err := polar.NewConsumer("polar://polar.streams", group, topic)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Discovered a cluster with %d brokers\n", consumer.BrokersLength())

for {
	pollResult := consumer.Poll()
	if pollResult.Error != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Found error while polling: %s", pollResult.Error)
		continue
	}

	// New records organized by topic
	for _, topicRecords := range pollResult.TopicRecords {
		for _, record := range topicRecords.Records {
			fmt.Println(string(record.Body), record.Timestamp)
		}
	}
}
```
